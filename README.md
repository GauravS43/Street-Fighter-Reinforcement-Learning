# Street Fighter Reinforcement Learning

Trained a model for Street Fighter 2 Special Champion Edition (Sega Genesis) in Python using Gym, Stable-Baselines3 and Gym Retro.

The model was trained using Proximal Policy Optimization for **5,000,000** steps using in-game score as a reward function.
At its peak, the model is capable of reaching up to Dhalsim in Ryu's arcade mode.
